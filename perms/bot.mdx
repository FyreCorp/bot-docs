## Default Permissions
By default, Fyre will request the "Administrator" permission.
This is to make configuration easier for our users, it doesn't require the "Administrator" permission to function.

Below is a list of permissions that Fyre requires at all times to function,
removing these permissions will prevent Fyre from responding to commands properly or sending messages.

- "Attach Files"
- "Embed Links"
- "Add Reactions"
- "View Channels"
- "Send Messages"
- "Use External Emojis"
- "Read Message History"

## Feature Specific Permissions
Additional permissions that certain features require to function properly.
