Fyre features a message templating system allowing you to replace messages that the app sends throughout your Discord server.
This templating system allows you to build embeds/containers or plaintext messages that you can use across Fyre.

## Creating a Template
To create a new message template, use `/templates create`.
This command supports the following options:

- `type`: The type of template to create (plaintext or container).
- `colour`: The colour (hex code) to use for the container colour.

A modal will be brought up where you can provide a name for your template, and the template code itself.


## Updating a Template
To update an existing message template, use `/templates update`.
This command supports the same options as the create command, and will bring up the same modal.


## Using Templates
In any part of Fyre that supports templates,
the associated config command should have an option with `template` in the name somewhere.

After updating modules with your message templates,
they will show your custom template in output instead of Fyre's default messages.

If your template fails to compile, you will see the error message outputted as the command response.
We strongly recommend you test your message templates after applying them to make sure they work.


## Deleting a Template
To delete a template, use `/templates delete` and provide the template you wish to delete.

<Warning>
Certain events or messages that require a message template will stop working after deleting a connected template.
Make sure to reset the config of any modules using message templates before deleting them.
