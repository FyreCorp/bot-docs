<Info>
Fyre's templating is based on [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars).
Visit their website to learn more advanced logic and syntax.

## Basic Syntax
Handlebars has a simple to use syntax for inserting variables into text.
Templating is built with [Fyre's Variables](./variables) in mind to give you the best experience.

You can use all
[Discord Markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline)
in your templates, Handlebars just adds additional syntax for variables.

To insert a variable, surround it in triple braces/curly brackets.
We use triple braces because they don't do [HTML Escaping](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#html-escaping).

If your variable won't return any special characters (`& \ " ' = <>`) you can use double braces instead of triple braces.
<CodeGroup>

```handlebars Template
Welcome {{{user.mention}}} to {{{guild.name}}}!
```

```txt Result
Welcome @Fallen to Fyre Support!
```

</CodeGroup>


## Basic Logic
Handlebars offers a few helpers to work with optional variables or do simple logic checks.

### If / If Else
To check if an optional variable exists, or if a boolean variable is true, use `#if`.
You don't need to have an `{{else}}` statement if you don't need one, but it's provided in this example anyway.

<CodeGroup>
```handlebars Template
{{#if track.nowPlaying}}
Track is Now Playing
{{else}}
Track isn't Playing
{{/if}}

Track Name: {{{track.name}}}
```

```txt Result (Playing)
Track is Now Playing

Track Name: The Outfield
```

```txt Result (Stopped)
Track isn't Playing

Track Name: The Outfield
```
</CodeGroup>

### Unless
Unless is the opposite of if. Use it to check if a variable doesn't exist, or if a boolean value is false, use `#unless`.

<CodeGroup>
```handlebars Template
{{#unless track.loved}}
Track isn't Loved!\n
{{/unless}}
Track Name: The Outfield
```

```txt Result (Loved)
Track Name: The Outfield
```

```txt Result (No Love)
Track isn't Loved!

Track Name: The Outfield
```
</CodeGroup>


## Custom Helpers
Fyre has some custom helpers to add additional functionality to Handlebars.

### Format Number
You can use the `formatNumber` helper to format long numbers with commas or periods.

This helper supports using an
[IETF Language Tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)
for regional formatting (eg. "en-US" or "en-DK").

<CodeGroup>
```handlebars Template
Track Name: {{{track.name}}}
Total Plays: {{formatNumber track.totalPlayCount}}
Total Plays (en-DK): {{formatNumber track.totalPlayCount "en-DK"}}
```

```txt Result
Track Name: The Outfield
Total Plays: 28,200
Total Plays (en-DK): 28.200
```
