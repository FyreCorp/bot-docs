The term "Fyre" refers to Fyre as an application on Discord.

The terms "we" and "us" refer to the Fyre Staff Team ("Fyre Team").

The terms "user" and "users" refer to user accounts on Discord.

The terms "server" and "servers" refer to servers ("guilds") on Discord.

This Privacy Policy outlines the data that Fyre stores, and what steps we take to protect your data.


## Data Fyre Collects
1. User configuration data. Fyre stores the unique user identifier ("User ID") attached to your Discord account,
a license check value (true/false),
the values of any settings you have changed in your `/home` panel,
and your Last.fm username and session key (if you have setup Last.fm).

2. Server configuration data. Fyre stores all data provided to it through the use of any admin commands in a server.
This includes but is not limited to:
the server's unique server identifier ("Guild ID"), Last.fm default template code, message templates,
auto responses or auto reactions, ticket categories, jail module configuration, whitelisted bot IDs,
snipe module configuration, afk module configuration, member backup module configuration, auto purge configurations,
auto thread configurations, and media only channel configurations.

3. Message content. Fyre stores the message content, message attachments, and unique user identifiers ("User IDs") of message authors
for up to 15 minutes after they have been updated or deleted. This content is used to provide the snipe module,
and can be easily disabled by server admins using `/config snipe`.


## Data Fyre Shares
1. Last.fm usernames and session keys.
Fyre will share your Last.fm username and session key with Last.fm when you use Last.fm related commands.

Fyre doesn't share any data with external services unless the data originated from those services.


## Data Protection
All data Fyre collects and stores is kept in a secured MongoDB instance, or in Fyre's process memory.
Fyre's MongoDB instances are hosted and secured directly by [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database).

Sensitive data like message content is only stored in memory, and never leaves Fyre's application process.


## Viewing and Deleting data
1. Viewing your data. You can view all stored data related to your user by using `/home`,
selecting the "Advanced" tab, and clicking/pressing "View Data".
After your data is collected, it will be delivered to you via Direct Message.

2. Deleting your data. You can delete all stored data related to your user by using `/home`,
selecting the "Advanced" tab, and clicking/pressing "Request Data Deletion".
We will delete all requested data within 10 business days,
and you will be Direct Messaged confirming your data deletion.

<Warning>
Deleting your data will result in losing your access to Fyre, as your license data will also be deleted.
Proceed with caution, and contact the Fyre Team in [Fyre Hub](https://discord.gg/SNxqD4ujTF) if you have any questions or concerns.
