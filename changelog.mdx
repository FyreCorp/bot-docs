<Update label="Jan 2026" description="Nov 1st (2025) - Jan 27th (2026)">
### VIP Module Introduction
Also known as boost roles on other bots, Fyre's VIP module allows a server to create up to 5 VIP tiers.
Each tier can come with a custom role, ping auto reactions, and keyword auto reactions.

You can also allow members to share their VIP role with other members via a customizable member limit.

To learn more, or how to get started, visit the [VIP Module Docs](/docs/modules/vip).

### Activity Module Introduction
Fyre now has an activity module, allowing server admins and owners to compile charts of staff activity in 3 categories:
tickets claimed, message counts, and minutes in voice calls.

You can compile a chart with up to 90 days of history.
Tickets will always work via `/activity tickets`,
but message counts and voice minutes need to be enabled via `/config activity`.

Fyre will only record minutes in voice, and the count of members' messages with the relevant settings enabled.
Message content and other information **isn't** recorded.

Voice and message recording are opt-in by role, if no roles are whitelisted in `/config activity`, no activity will be recorded.

### Jail Module Update
Added the ability to create jails as locked (use the "locked" option).
Locked jails will require a member with the same role or higher to unjail, or a member with the "Administrator" permission.

### Other changes in this update
- Added the ability to create private VCs linked to tickets (`/ticket-vc`, `>tvc`).
By default only ticket staff can create VCs, this can be changed via `/categories update permissions`.
- Added button selection to `/categories greeting` where you can choose which buttons
appear under the ticket greeting embed (supporting the new "Create VC" button).
- Improved display of ticket history in `/history tickets`.
- Added `>unafk` and `>setafk` commands for admins to have fun with the AFK system.
- Added required roles to auto responses, allowing admins to lock auto-responses behind certain roles.
- Fixed various issues with command responses pinging roles or users unintentionally.
- Added new `/channels config` command where you can update multiple channel modules at once (auto purge, auto threading, media, etc).
- Added "allow-gifs" option to channel media mode (`/channels media`).
- Added the ability to directly give users permissions via `/permissions`.
- Improved ticket panel creation experience via `/ticket-panel`.
