## Random Commands
- `/whois`: View advanced information about a user including creation date, join date, role list, permissions list, and more.
- `/server`: View advanced information about the current server including creation date, server owner, role/channel counts, flags, boosts, and more.
- `/colour`: View an image representation of a provided colour in hex code format.

## Role Commands
Fyre's primary role command for easily adding roles to or removing roles from a user is `/role` (`/role @user <role-string>`).

A role string is a comma separated list of role IDs, role mentions, or role names.
By default, Fyre will toggle the role (remove if the member already has it, or add if not).

To override this behaviour, you can prefix individual roles with `+` or `-` to force them to be added or removed.
You can also prefix the role string with `++` or `--` to force all roles to be added or removed.

<br/>

Fyre also has a bulk role command to add a role to or remove a role from an entire server or role at once.
Using `/roles bulk` (`/roles bulk +/- @role [@role-filter]`) you can easily add or remove a role to/from many members at once.
