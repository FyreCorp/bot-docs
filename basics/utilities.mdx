## Random Commands
- `/whois`: View advanced information about a user including creation date, join date, role list, permissions list, and more.
- `/server`: View advanced information about the current server including creation date, server owner, role/channel counts, flags, boosts, and more.
- `/colour`: View an image representation of a provided colour in hex code format.


## Role Commands
Fyre's primary role command for easily adding roles to or removing roles from a user is `/role` (`/role @user <role-string>`).

A role string is a comma separated list of role IDs, role mentions, or role names.
By default, Fyre will toggle the role (remove if the member already has it, or add if not).

To override this behaviour, you can prefix individual roles with `+` or `-` to force them to be added or removed.
You can also prefix the role string with `++` or `--` to force all roles to be added or removed.

<br/>

Fyre also has a bulk role command to add a role to or remove a role from an entire server or role at once.
Using `/roles bulk` (`/roles bulk +/- @role [@role-filter]`) you can easily add or remove a role to/from many members at once.

### Role Management Commands
Fyre has a few role management commands for creating, updating, and deleting roles.

You can use `/roles create` to quickly and easily create a role, it supports the following options:
- `name`: A name for the role (max 64 chars).
- `[colour]`: A colour (hex code) for the role.
- `[hoisted]`: A true or false value if the role should be hoisted.
- `[mentionable]`: A true or false value if the role should be mentionable.
- `[permissions]`: A permissions value for the role (should be an integer).

To quickly update a role, use `/roles update @role`. This command supports the same options as the roles create command.

If you want to delete a role, you can use `/roles delete @role` to easily delete it.
Be warned, there is no confirmation prompt, just instant deletion.


## Channel Commands
Fyre offers a few bulk commands for channels to automate creating or deleting channels.

You can use `/channels bulk-create` to create a numbered list of channels (up to 10 at a time).
This command is useful if you need to create a large amount of temporary chats. It supports the following options:

- `type`: The type of channels to create (text or voice).
- `count`: The total number of channels to create (max 10).
- `name-format`: A name format for the new channels, use \{count\} for the channel number.
- `[category]`: A category channel to create the channels under.
- `[start-at]`: The count to start at, useful for creating more then 10 channels.
- `[permissions]`: A permissions array for the channels, should be in the
following format: `<role-id>:<allow-perm-value>:<deny-perm-value>`.
- `[age-restricted]`: A true or false value if the channels should be marked as age restricted.

You can use `/channels bulk-delete` to delete channels in bulk by name match. This command supports the following options:

- `[type]`: The type of channel to delete.
- `[category]`: The category to delete channels from.
- `[name-includes]`: An includes filter for the name of the channel, case sensitive.
- `[name-starts-with]`: An includes filter for the start of channel names, case sensitive.
- `[name-ends-with]`: An includes filter for the end of channel names, case sensitive.
