## Default Prefix
Fyre's default prefix is `>`. If you want to change the prefix, use `/config general prefix: <new-prefix>`.
If you have forgotten the prefix, simply ping/mention Fyre and it will respond with the current prefix (eg. @Fyre).

## Text Command Syntax
By default, Fyre has 3 ways to specify options in text commands.

For commands that only have 1 or 2 options, or all options are required
(eg. ticket staff commands) the syntax is `>command <option-1> <option-2>`.

For the rest of Fyre's text commands, the syntax is
`>command --option-1: value-1 --option-2: value-2` or `>command option-1: value-1 option-2: value-2`.

You can use `--option` or `option:` interchangeably in commands as you please.
There is no need for quotes around values, as values include spaces by default.

If you need help with a command's syntax, simply use the command with no options provided `>command`.
