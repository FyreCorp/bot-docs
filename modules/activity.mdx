## How it Works
When enabled, Fyre will record the minutes a user spends in VC, and the amount of messages they send in the server.

Fyre will only record these analytics from members with one of the module's whitelisted roles.
You can also blacklist channels that activity will be ignored in.

Fyre will only record minutes in voice, and total message counts (per day) when the relevant settings are enabled.
Fyre **will not** record any other data about voice activity or message activity.


## Usage
To compile an activity report, use one of the following activity commands:

- `/activity voice [days]` - Compile an activity report of server members' voice activity (minutes in voice, default 7 days).
- `/activity messages [days]` - Compile an activity report of server members' message activity (message counts, default 7 days).
- `/activity tickets <days> <categories>` - Compile an activity report of server members' ticket activity (tickets claimed).

<Info>
You must have the [`utility.activity`](/basics/permissions#advanced-permissions) fake permission,
or the Administrator Discord permission to use these commands.

## Configuring
To configure the activity module, use `/config activity`.
You can use this command with no options to view your current activity config.
This command supports the following options:

- `bar-color` - The HEX color of bars in activity reports.
- `record-voice-activity` - If voice activity should be recorded (default: No).
- `record-message-activity` - If message activity should be recorded (default: No).
- `whitelisted-roles` - A comma separated list of whitelisted roles.
- `add-blacklisted-channels` - A comma separated list of blacklisted channels to add.
- `remove-blacklisted-channels` - A comma separated list of blacklisted channels to remove.
