<Tip>All user-facing VIP commands are slash commands and text commands.</Tip>

## How it Works
You can create up to 5 VIP tiers per server.
Each VIP tier can have a specifc role member limit, reaction limit, and reaction trigger limit.

Every VIP tier must be tied to a primary role, this role determines whether a member has access to that tier's features.
If a member's primary role changes to a different tier's,
Fyre will automatically update their VIP profile accordingly next time they bring up the VIP panel.

Server members can use `/vip info` or `>vip` to bring up the VIP panel.
The VIP panel will display VIP role and reaction information, and allow the member to update their VIP role (if enabled).

If a VIP member leaves the server, Fyre will automatically delete their VIP role and reactions.
Their VIP profile will remain in the database for 7 days,
in which they can join back and bring up the VIP panel to restore their role and or reactions.

If a VIP member loses their tier's primary role, Fyre will automatically delete their VIP role and reactions.
Storing it for 7 days as mentioned above.

The same policy applies if the member loses their tier's primary role.

If a VIP member's tier changes, Fyre will automatically delete and re-create their role and reactions (if enabled).


## Managing VIP Roles & Reactions
Members can manage their VIP role via the buttons under their VIP panel.

To add or remove triggers, members can use `/vip triggers add`, `/vip triggers remove`, and `/vip triggers clear`.

To add or remove reactions, members can use `/vip reactions add`, `/vip reactions remove`, and `/vip reactions clear`.

The member's ping/mention, and role ping/mention don't count towards their total triggers, and are always active.

Members' can share their role with other members using `/vip share`.


## Managing VIP Tiers
To create a VIP tier, use `/vip-admin tiers create`. This command supports the following options:

- `name` - The name of the VIP tier (max 32 chars).
- `primary-role` - The primary role that the VIP tier will be linked to.
- `role-enabled` - If the VIP tier should have an included custom role.
- `role-member-limit` - The default member limit for the included custom role.
- `role-hoistable` - If the included custom role should be hoistable.
- `role-mentionable` - If the included custom role should be mentionable.
- `trigger-limit` - The limit of auto reaction triggers to include (leave blank to disable auto reactions).
- `reaction-limit` - The limit of auto reactions to include (leave blank to disable auto reactions).
- `position-under-role` - The role to create new custom roles under (leave blank to create roles at the bottom of the role hierarchy).

To update a VIP tier, use `/vip-admin tiers update`. This command supports the same options above.

To delete a VIP tier, use `/vip-admin tiers delete` and specify the tier you want to delete.


## Managing VIP Profiles
To manually set a member's custom role, or update their role or reaction limits, use `/vip-admin profiles update`.
This command supports the following options:

- `user` - The member to update.
- `role` - The new VIP/custom role for the member.
- `triggers` - A limit change string for the member's auto reaction triggers.
- `reactions` - A limit change string for the member's auto reactions.
- `role-members` - A limit change string for the member's custom role members.

A limit change string can be one of 4 things:
1. 0 -- if you specify 0, it will reset the member's limit to the default for that tier.
2. A solid number -- if you specify a solid number, it will set that member's limit to the provided number.
3. A positive number -- if you specify a positive number (+ prefix), it will increase that member's limit by the provided number.
4. A negative number -- if you specify a negative number (- prefix), it will decrease that member's limit by the provided number.

To delete a member's VIP profile, role, and auto reactions, use `/vip-admin profiles delete` and specify the user to delete.


## Global VIP Config
There are some global settings for the VIP module, these can be configured using `/vip-admin config`.
This command supports the following options:

- `delete-role-on-tier-change` - If VIP roles should be automatically deleted and re-created when a member's VIP tier changes (default: No).
