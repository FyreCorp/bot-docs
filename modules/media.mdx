## Configuring
Configure Fyre to automatically delete messages that don't contain media or aren't spoilered in a specific channel.

To configure media mode in a channel, use `/channels media`.
This command supports the following options:

- `media-only`: If media-only mode is enabled in the target channel (default: No).
- `include-bots`: If messages from bots should be checked for media (default: No).
- `require-spoiler`: If all media should be required to be spoilered when posted (default: No).
- `logs-channel`: A channel to post deletion logs to (default: None).
