## Usage
You can easily jail a user by using `/jail @user [reason] [locked]`.
To unjail a user, use `/unjail @user`.

If a jail is locked, only a staff member with the same role or higher,
or the Administrator permission can unjail the user


## Configuring
To configure the jail module, use `/config jail`. This command supports the following options:

- `enabled` - A true or false value if the jail module is enabled.
- `category` - A ticket category to create jail tickets in (leave blank for no tickets, null to reset).
- `remove-roles` - A true or false value if a member's roles should be removed when they are jailed (default: Yes).
- `prevent-role-changes` - If changes to a member's roles should be reversed while they are jailed (default: Yes).

### Jail Roles
You can update your servers jail roles by using `/config jail-roles`.
This will bring up a select menu where you can choose up to 5 jail roles.
