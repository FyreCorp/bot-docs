## Usage
You can easily jail a user by using `/jail @user [reason]`. To unjail a user, use `/unjail @user`.


## Configuring
To configure the jail module, use `/config jail`. This command supports the following options:

- `enabled`: A true or false value if the jail module is enabled.
- `category`: A ticket category to create jail tickets in (leave blank for no tickets, null to reset).
- `remove-roles`: A true or false value if a member's roles should be removed when they are jailed.

### Jail Roles
You can add or remove jail roles using `/config jail-roles add @role` and `/config jail-roles remove @role`.
