## Creating a Ticket Panel
To create a ticket panel, use `/ticket-panel`.
This command supports the following options:

- `type`: The type of ticket panel to create (buttons or select menu).
- `channel`: The channel to send the newly created ticket panel to.
- `colour`: The embed/container colour of the new ticket panel (HEX code).
- `image-url`: The URL of an image to use in the ticket panel.
- `thumbnail-url`: The URL of a thumbnail to use in the ticket panel.
- `button-name`: The name of the button on the ticket panel (single category only).
- `select-menu-placeholder`: The placeholder text to show in the select menu (select menu panel type only).


## Panel Template
After using the `/ticket-panel` command, you will see a modal.
Inside this modal, you can provide your [template code](/templating/syntax) for the ticket panel.
Ticket panels only support [Guild/Server Variables](/templating/variables#guild%2Fserver-variables).

## Panel Categories
After submitting the template modal, you can use the select menu to choose the ticket categories for this panel.
You can select a maximum of 5 categories per panel. If you need to display more, create a second ticket panel.
