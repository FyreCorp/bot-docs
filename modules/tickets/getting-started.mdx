{/* [Tp/click here](/modules/tickets/options) to learn more about this command's options. */}

### Create Category Options
Below is a list of all the options you can provide when creating a ticket category and what they're for.

- `name`: The name for the new ticket category (will be shown in related panels and in the `/open` command).
- `description`: A description for the category (max 100 chars) that will be shown in select menus.
- `server-category`: The category channel to create new tickets in.
- `logs-channel`: The text channel to send ticket logs to (ticket closed, transcripts, etc).


## Category Modal/Questions
You can add up to 5 questions per category that will be presented to the user when they attempt to open a ticket.

To create a new question for a category, use `/category questions add`.
All fields correspond to the same field for a
[Text Input Component](https://discord.com/developers/docs/components/reference#text-input)
of a modal.

To delete a question, use `/category questions remove` and provide the category and question you want to remove.


## Category Roles (Ping, Staff, Required)
With Fyre you can have up to 10 roles in each related field per category.
To manage category roles, use `/categories roles add` and `/categories roles remove`.

Ping roles are the roles that Fyre will ping when a ticket is opened, or when a ticket close request is made.

Staff roles are the roles that will be able to see all newly-created tickets, and manage them.

Required roles are roles that a member must have before opening a ticket in a specific category.
With Fyre, a member must only have **one** of the required roles to open a ticket in a locked category.


## Welcome Panel
You can customise Fyre's welcome panel (the first message sent in the ticket) quite extensively.

<Tip>
The welcome panel supports Fyre's [Variables](/misc/variables).
You can use any of these in the embed title or description.
</Tip>

To change the basics like the title and description, use `/categories welcome-panel embed`.

You can also change the name, colour, and position of the buttons under the panel, or disable certain buttons entirely.
To update these buttons, use `/categories welcome-panel buttons`.


## Confirmation Prompt
Fyre features an optional confirmation prompt when opening tickets.
When enabled, members will be shown the provided message and have to
wait x amount of seconds before confirming and opening the ticket.

To enable, disable, or update a category's confirmation prompt, use `/categories confirmation-prompt`.

There are 2 modes available, Plain and Embed.
Plain will show a plaintext confirmation message with a header title and regular description.
Embed will show the same confirmation message but inside an embed, using the category's colour.
