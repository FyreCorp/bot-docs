## Usage
You can easily lock a channel using `/lock`, and unlock a channel using `/unlock`.

## How it Works
By default, Fyre will deny "Send Messages" permissions for **all role overwrites** on a channel, including @everyone.

When unlocking, Fyre will grant "Send Messages" to all role overwrites that previously had the "Send Messages" permission,
and @everyone if it previously had "Send Messages".

## Customising Behaviour
You can change which roles Fyre locks out of channels on a per channel or per server basis.

To add or remove a lock role, use `/config lock-roles add` and `/config lock-roles remove`.
To add a lock role to a channel, specify the channel when using the above commands.

When adding lock roles to the server,
Fyre will overwrite locked channels allowing lock roles the "Send Messages" permission in locked channels.

When adding lock roles to a channel,
Fyre will overwrite that channel when locked, allowing lock roles the "Send Messages" permission.

<Info>
If a channel has it's own lock roles, Fyre will ignore the server's lock roles when that channel is locked.
