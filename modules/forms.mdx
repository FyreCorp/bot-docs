## Ping Roles
Ping roles are roles that Fyre will ping/mention when a new form submission is created.

You can add or remove ping roles using
`/forms roles add type:Ping Role` and `/forms roles remove type:Ping Role`.


## Required Roles
Required roles are roles that a member requires to fill out the form.
A member must have one of the required roles to fill out a form.

You can add or remove required roles using
`/forms roles add type:Required Role` and `/forms roles remove type:Required Role`.


## Confirmation Prompt
Every form has a confirmation prompt that is enabled by default,
this is to prevent accidental form submissions from being created.

Users will be shown this confirmation prompt whenever they attempt 
to start a form submission via a form panel or the `/form` command.

You can customize this confirmation prompt to say whatever you prefer easily using `/forms confirmation`.
This command support the following options:

- `form` - The form ID to update (autocomplete).
- `enabled` - Whether the confirmation prompt is enabled for this form (Yes or No).
- `delay` - The delay in seconds a user must wait before starting the form (default: none, min: 5, max: 30).
- `mode` - The mode for displaying the confirmation prompt (Plain or Container, default: Plain).

After using this command, a modal will popup allowing you to enter a custom template for the confirmation prompt.
This template supports [Guild](/templating/variables#guild%2Fserver-variables)
and [Form](/templating/variables#feature-specific-variables) variables.
