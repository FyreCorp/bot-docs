## Creating
To create an auto response, use `/responses create`.
This command supports the following options:

- `type` - The type of auto response to create (reply, message, or reaction).
- `name` - A unique name for the auto response (only for identifying the auto response).
- `triggers` - A comma separated list of triggers for the auto response (max 3).`
- `content` - The text content of the auto response, if the type is reply or message. If not, a comma separated list of emojis (max 5).
- `required-roles` - A comma separated list of required roles to trigger this auto response.

### Auto Response Types
There are 3 types of auto responses, here's the gist if it.

- `reply` - A normal text-based message reply to the triggering message.
- `message` - A normal text-based message sent in the channel of the triggering message.
- `reaction` - An auto reaction of up to 5 emojis to the triggering message.


## Updating
To update an auto response, use `/responses update <response>`.
This command supports all the same options as the create command.


## Deleting
To delete an auto response, use `/responses delete <response>`.

<Warning>
Once you delete an auto response, it can't be recovered. Use this command with caution.
</Warning>
