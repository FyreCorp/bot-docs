## How it Works
When configured, Fyre's join gate module will auto-kick new users with accounts that are too young.
Fyre will attempt to DM the user on kick to notify them why they have been kicked.


## Configuring
To configure the join gate module, use `/config join-gate`.
This command supports the following options:

- `enabled` - If the join gate module is enabled (default: No).
- `minimum-account-age` - The minimum account age in days for new members (default: None, max: 90, 0 to reset).
