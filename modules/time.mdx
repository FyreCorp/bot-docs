## Usage
To view another user's current time, use `/time show` (`>time @user`).
To set your own time zone, use `/time set [city]`.


## How it Works
When a member sends a message containing a time (eg. 16:00, 4:00 pm, 4pm), and they have their time zone set,
Fyre will reply to the message with a timestamp so all members can see that time in their local time zone.


## Configuring
You can easily customize Fyre's time converter using `/config time-converter`.
This command supports the following options:

- `enabled` - If automatic time conversion is enabled (Yes or No, default: Yes).
- `show-template` - The ID of a template to replace the default `/time show` reply (autocomplete, null to reset).
- `conversion-template` - The ID of a template to replace the auto converted reply messages (autocomplete, null to reset).
