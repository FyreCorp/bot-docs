## Configuring
You can use the `/config snipe` command to easily configure sniping in your server.
This command supports the following options:

- `enabled`: If sniping is enabled in the current server.

### Ignoring Channels
If a channel is on the ignore list, Fyre won't store or display deleted or edited messages in that channel.

To add a channel to the ignore list, use `/config snipe-ignore add`.

To remove a channel from the ignore list, use `/config snipe-ignore remove`.
