<Tip>Last.fm is a user feature, and can be used with a user license or a server license.</Tip>

## Getting Started
To get started with Last.fm, use `/fm`. This will bring up the login prompt.
Follow the instructions to Login to Last.fm and connect Fyre to your Last.fm account.

After connecting your account, you can use `/fm` to display your now playing or most recently played track on Last.fm.


## Theming
To change or update your Last.fm panel theme, use `/home` and select the Last.fm tab.

Once you have the Last.fm tab of the Home Panel open, use the "Change Theme" button to bring up the theme selector.
If you choose "Custom" in the theme select menu, you'll be able to write your own template with Fyre's [Templating](../misc/templating).

After changing themes or update your custom theme,
the theme selector panel will update to show a preview of your selected theme with sample data.

### Colour
By default, your Default Colour will be shown as the colour for your Last.fm panel.

If you change the colour in the colour selector to "Automatic",
Fyre will attempt to extract the prominent colour from the album artwork and use that as the panel colour.

### Thumbnail
To enable or disable displaying the album artwork as your panel's thumbnail,
use the "Disable Thumbnail" or "Enable Thumbnail" button next to the "Change Theme" button.


## Disconnecting
If you want to disconnect your Last.fm account or reset your Last.fm config,
use the "Disconnect Last.fm" or "Reset Last.fm Config" buttons.

If you disconnect your Last.fm account, your username and session key will be deleted but your theme will be kept.
