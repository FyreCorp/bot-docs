## Whitelisted Bots
Fyre has a whitelisted bots option that allows you to easily whitelist any Discord app to run some moderation or utility commands on Fyre.

To whitelist a bot, use `/config whitelisted-bots add @bot`. To remove a whitelisted bot, use `/config whitelisted-bots remove @bot`.


### Supported Bot Commands
The following commands are the only ones currently supported to be used by bots:
- `>jail`
- `>unjail`

If you want to use a different command in your automations, feel free to join our Discord server and leave a suggestion.
