To bring up your VIP panel, use `/vip info`. Your VIP panel will show info related to your VIP role and or reactions.

<Info>
All VIP commands are text and slash commands. Fyre's default text prefix is `>`.
When in doubt, simply ping/mention @Fyre in any channel, and it'll reply with the current prefix.

## Customizing your VIP Role
To update your role's name, hoist status, mentionable status, or icon, tap/click the "Update" button under your VIP panel.
If you don't see a box to upload an icon, it means the server hasn't unlocked role icons.

To update your role's colors, tap/click the "Change Colors" button under your VIP panel.
You'll be able to choose a solid colour, gradient, or holographic style if available in the server.


## Sharing your VIP Role
To share your VIP role with another member, use `/vip share`.
You can use the same command to remove your role from someone you previously shared it with.

You'll only be able to share your role with members within your member limit.
To increase your role's member limit, contact server admins.


## Using your VIP Reactions
To update your reactions, use `/vip reactions add`, `/vip reactions remove`, and `/vip reactions clear`.
You can use any emoji from any server Fyre is in as a reaction.

When adding or removing vip triggers, you can specify multiple emojis separated by commas.
Fyre will add or remove all specified emojis at once.

To update your reaction triggers, use `/vip triggers add`, `/vip triggers remove`, and `/vip triggers clear`.
Triggers must be at least 2 characters long, and be unique to the server (no other member is using it).

Your user ping/mention, and your VIP role ping/mention are always included as triggers,
and don't count towards your total trigger limit.
