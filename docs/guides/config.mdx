How you can customize your Last.fm embed across Discord.
All Last.fm configuration can be done from the `/home` panel on the Last.fm tab.

### Theming
You can use the "Change Theme" button to bring up the theme selector.
If you choose "Custom" in the theme select menu, you'll be able to write [your own template](../templating/syntax).

After changing themes or update your custom theme,
the theme selector panel will update to show a preview of your selected theme with sample data.

### Embed/Container Color
By default, Fyre will extract and use the prominent color from the song's album artwork.

If you want to manually override the container color, you can change the selector to "Default Color".
You can set your default color from the main page of your `/home` panel.

### Thumbnail
To enable or disable displaying the album artwork as your panel's thumbnail,
use the "Disable Thumbnail" or "Enable Thumbnail" button next to the "Change Theme" button.

### Resetting
To disconnect your Last.fm account, or reset your Last.fm config, use the "Reset Last.fm Config" button.

After confirming, this will disconnect your Last.fm account, and reset all Last.fm settings to their defaults.
