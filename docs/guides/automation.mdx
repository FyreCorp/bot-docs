## Whitelisted Bots
Fyre has a whitelisted bots option that allows you to whitelist any Discord app to run some commands on Fyre.

To whitelist a bot, use `/config whitelisted-bots add <bot>`.
To remove a whitelisted bot, use `/config whitelisted-bots remove <bot>`.


## Supported Commands
The following commands are the only ones currently supported to be used by bots:
- `>jail`
- `>unjail`
