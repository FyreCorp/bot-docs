<Tip>
Last.fm is a user feature, and can be used with a user license or a server license.
</Tip>

## How it Works
By default, all members can use `/fm` in your server to view their currently playing or last played song on Last.fm.

You can change the default template of the `/fm` panel for all members in your server,
except those with their own custom themes.


## Configuring
To change the default template of the `/fm` panel, use `/config last-fm`.
Fyre will respond with a modal where you can enter a custom
[Last.fm message template](../templating/defaults#last-fm-template).
