## How it Works
When setup, Fyre will automatically respond to specifc trigger words with reactions or a custom message.

You can also configure per-channel auto-reactions, where Fyre will auto-react to every message in a channel.


## Global Auto Responses
Auto responses that work in any channel in your server.

### Creating
To create an auto response, use `/responses create`.
This command supports the following options:

- `type` - The type of auto response to create (reply, message, or reaction).
- `name` - A unique name for the auto response (only for identifying the auto response).
- `triggers` - A comma separated list of triggers for the auto response (max 3).`
- `content` - The text content of the auto response, if the type is reply or message. If not, a comma separated list of emojis (max 5).
- `required-roles` - A comma separated list of required roles to trigger this auto response.

#### Auto Response Types
There are 3 types of auto responses, here's the gist if it.

- `reply` - A normal text-based message reply to the triggering message.
- `message` - A normal text-based message sent in the channel of the triggering message.
- `reaction` - An auto reaction of up to 5 emojis to the triggering message.

### Updating
To update an auto response, use `/responses update <response>`.
This command supports all the same options as the create command.

### Deleting
To delete an auto response, use `/responses delete <response>`.

<Warning>
Once you delete an auto response, it can't be recovered. Use this command with caution.
</Warning>


## Per-channel Auto Responses
Per-channel auto responses make Fyre auto-react to every message in a channel.

To configure per-channel auto-reactions, use `/channels auto-react #channel`.
This command supports the following options:

- `enabled` - If auto-reactions are enabled in the target channel (default: No).
- `reactions` - A comma separated list of auto reactions for the target channel (default: None, max: 5, null to reset).
- `include-bots` - If messages sent from bots in the target channel should be auto-reacted to (default: No).
- `affect-children` - If messages sent in child channels (threads) should be auto-reacted to (default: No).
- `ignored-users` - A comma separated list of users to ignore when auto-reacting.
