## How it Works
When enabled, Fyre will automatically delete all messages in a channel after a certain delay.

You can enable auto-purging for as many channels as you'd like in your server.


## Configuring
Configure Fyre to automatically delete messages sent in a specific channel.

To configure auto-purge in a channel, use `/channels auto-purge`.
This command supports the following options:

- `enabled`: If auto-purge is enabled in the target channel (default: No).
- `delay`: The amount of time to wait before deleting a message in seconds (default: 300).
- `include-bots`: If messages sent from bots should be auto-purged (default: No).
