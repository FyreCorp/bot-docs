## Info Commands
A list of commands that provide information about Fyre, a user, or a server.

- `/ping` - View Fyre's current ping, and the current server's shard (if in a server).
- `/server` - View information about the current server, including it's owner, statistics, and more.
- `/whois` - View information about a specific user, including their roles and more in the current server.
  - `/whois @user`


## Role Commands
A list of commands for giving roles to members and managing roles in your server.

A role string is a comma separated list of role names, mentions, or IDs.
By default, Fyre will toggle the specified roles for the target member.

To override this behaviour, you can prefix roles with `+` to only add them, or `-` to only remove them.

You can also prefix the role string with `++` to only add all roles, or `--` to only remove all roles.

- `/role` `>r` - Add or remove roles to/from a user in bulk.
  - `/role @user <role-string>` 
- `/roles icon` `>ricon` - Change a role's icon with an emoji or attached image.
  - `/roles icon @role [icon-file] [icon-emoji]`
- `/roles move` `>rmove` - Move a role above or below another role on the hierarchy.
  - `/roles move @role top/above/below/bottom`
- `/roles bulk` - Add or remove a role from all servers members, or members with/without another role.
  - `/roles bulk +/- @role [with-role] [without-role] [exclude-bots]`
- `/roles color` `>rcolor` - Change a role's color(s) with hex codes.
  - `/roles color @role [primary-color] [secondary-color] [--holographic]`
- `/roles create` `>rcreate` - Create a new role in the server.
  - `/roles create <name> [hoisted] [mentionable]`
- `/roles update` `>rupdate` - Update an existing role in the server.
